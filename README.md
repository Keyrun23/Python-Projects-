Electric Vehicle Purchases Analysis 🚗⚡






Python Project | Master’s Program | November 2023



📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my Master’s coursework in Python Programming during November 2023. It explores a dataset on electric vehicle purchases in Washington State to:

Identify trends and patterns in electric vehicle adoption.
Build a machine learning model to predict Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.
This hands-on project allowed me to apply my Python skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning while exploring real-world data.



💾 Dataset Summary
Entries: 159,467
Key Features:
Model Year
Electric Range
Base MSRP
Legislative District
2020 Census Tract
And more!
The dataset provided rich information for analyzing consumer behavior and understanding electric vehicle trends.



🛠 Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I conducted EDA to uncover patterns and trends.

Descriptive Statistics: Summarized numerical features like Model Year, Electric Range, and Base MSRP.
Visualizations:
Distribution of electric vehicle types.
Trends in Electric Range over years.
Geographical patterns in purchases.
2. Classification Model
To predict CAFV eligibility, I used machine learning techniques with Python's Scikit-learn library:

Model: HistGradientBoostingClassifier.
Features: Key attributes like Model Year, Electric Range, and Base MSRP.
Evaluation: Achieved 100% accuracy on the test data. Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics confirmed the model's performance.
🎯 Key Insights
🚀 Electric Vehicle Trends
Purchases have surged in recent years, showing rapid adoption.
Significant variability in Electric Range and Base MSRP, reflecting diverse consumer needs.
🗺 Geographical Insights
Purchases were spread across Washington State, with representation from various legislative districts and census tracts.
🤖 Predictive Model Success
The CAFV eligibility prediction model performed exceptionally, achieving 100% accuracy, making it a reliable tool for stakeholders.
🔍 Business Implications
Rising Adoption: Growing consumer interest in electric vehicles signals market expansion.
Diverse Preferences: Manufacturers and policymakers should cater to a broad spectrum of preferences.
Model Applications: A robust CAFV eligibility prediction tool can streamline decision-making for eligibility assessments.
💡 What I Learned
This project was an enriching part of my Master’s program and taught me:

Data Wrangling and EDA: How to clean, analyze, and extract insights from raw data.
Machine Learning: Building and evaluating a classification model.
Python Proficiency: Leveraging Python libraries for efficient analysis and visualization.
Storytelling with Data: Presenting findings in a way that’s useful to stakeholders.
